## **What is Vuesoma?**


*Vuesoma* is a project that represents a standard structure for building modular web applications in combination with modern toolings and supported javascript libraries. *Vuesoma* uses `Vue.js` as the progressive framework for building user interfaces. `Vue.js` is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. This core library is focused on the view layer only and it offers a fully system for a fast development environment via `@vue/cli`:

Vue CLI provides:

* Interactive project scaffolding.
* Zero config rapid prototyping.

	* Upgradeable;
	* Built on top of webpack, with sensible defaults;
	* Configurable via in-project config file;
	* Extensible via plugins
* A rich collection of official plugins for integrating the best tools in the frontend ecosystem.
* A full graphical user interface to create and manage `Vue.js` projects.

*Vuesoma* aims to be an assembled structure of libraries and functionalities to cover the needs of a scalable modular web application.
